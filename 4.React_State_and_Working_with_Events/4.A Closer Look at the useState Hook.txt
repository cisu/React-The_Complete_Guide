use State registres some State so some value as a State
for the component in which it is being called.

More precise. It registers it for a specific component instance.

For example, ExpenseItem is being used for times.
And Expenses.js we hae four ExpenseItems.

Now every item receives its own separate State.
Which is detached from the other States.

foreach <ExpenseItem /> definition the ExpenseItem function is basically called four times. 
And every time it's called, a new separate State is created.
Of course in the same way but managed independently by React.

So if we change the title in the first ExpenseItem
the other ones are not affected because they have their own State.
it's on a per component instance basic.


////////////////////////////////
So why we use const when we do eventually assing a new value?

keep in mind that we're not assigning a value with the equal sign.

title = something

That would indeed fail. but that iss not how we assign a new value. When we update a State.


Instead we call this State updating function.
And the concrete value is simply managed somewhere else.
